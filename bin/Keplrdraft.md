### Keplr/GRAV integration

Currently Keplr provides only Alpha support for GRAV tokens. As a result, Keplr is missing many common functionalities (e.g. staking, transfer, IBC transfer, and proper display of token balance and IBC token inventory). \n\n

Such actions have been thus far been accomplished by connecting Keplr to an external site (such as the indispensable https://skynetexplorers.com/) or via the CLI. \n\n
The cost for establishing full Keplr support (for both their mobile apps and browser wallet extensions) is 1,135,015 GRAV. \n\n

Adding Keplr support would make the user experience more intuitive and inline with the many other projects utilizing Keplr wallet. \n\n

**Summary**
If passed this proposal would disperse 1,135,015 GRAV from the Gravity Bridge Community Pool to a multi-sig account, which in turn will disperse the funds to the Keplr team. \n\n

The members of the multi-sig wallet will be: \n\n

Zaki Manian, Sommelier/Iqlusion  \n\n
Ethan Kravitz, AGE Fund  \n\n
Å½ygimantas Magelinskas, Figment
