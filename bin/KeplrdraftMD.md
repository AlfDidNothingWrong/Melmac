### Keplr/GRAV integration
Currently Keplr provides only Alpha support for GRAV tokens. As a result, Keplr is presently missing many features (e.g. staking, transfer, IBC transfer, and proper display of token balance and IBC token inventory). <br><br>
Such actions have been thus far been accomplished by connecting Keplr to an external site (such as the indispensable https://skynetexplorers.com/) or via the CLI.<br><br> The cost for establishing full Keplr support (for both their mobile apps and browser wallet extensions) is: 1,135,015 GRAV.<br><br>
Adding Keplr support would make the user experience more intuitive and bring the GRAV/Keplr experience inline with the many other projects utilizing Keplr wallet.<br><br><br><br>
**Summary**<br><br> If passed, this proposal would disperse 1,135,015 GRAV from the Gravity Bridge Community Pool to a multi-sig account, which in turn will disperse the funds to the Keplr team.<br><br>
The members of the multi-sig wallet are:<br><br>
Zaki Manian, Sommelier/Iqlusion<br>
Ethan Kravitz, AGE Fund<br>
Å½ygimantas Magelinskas, Figment
